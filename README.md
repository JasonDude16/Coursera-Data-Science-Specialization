# Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization
This repository contains some of the assignments and projects I completed for Coursera's [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) by Johns Hopkins University. This specialization works through the entire data science pipeline, from gathering data to implementing scalable data science products.

## 1- [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](./1-%20The%20Data%20Scientist's%20Toolbox)
This course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. 

## 2- [R Programming](./2-%20R%20Programming)
This course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code.

## 3- [Getting and Cleaning Data](./3-%20Getting%20and%20Cleaning%20Data)
The course covers obtaining data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from colleagues in various formats. The course also covers the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. 

## 4- [Exploratory Data Analysis](./4-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data, including some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

## 5- [Reproducible Research](./5-%20Reproducible%20Research) 
This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner.

## 6- [Statistical Inference](./6-%20Statistical%20Inference) 
This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. 

## 7- [Regression Models](./7-%20Regression%20Models)
This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA is covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated.

## 8- [Practical Machine Learning](./8-%20Practical%20Machine%20Learning)
This course covers the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications. The course covers the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.

## 9- [Developing Data Products](./9-%20Developing%20Data%20Products) 
This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics.
