# Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization
This repository contains some of the assignments and projects I completed for Coursera's [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) by Johns Hopkins University. This specialization works through the entire data science pipeline, from gathering the data to implementing a scalable data science products. Here is the [link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/FD2E6Z2JZG3Q) to my certificate of complettion.

# The Data Scientist's Toolbox
This course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. 

# R Programming
This course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code.

# Getting and Cleaning Data
The course covers obtaining data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from colleagues in various formats. The course also covers the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis 
This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data, including some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

# Reproducible Research 
This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner.

# Statistical Inference 
This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. 

# Regression Models
This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA is covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated.

# Practical Machine Learning
This course covers the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications. The course introduces a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course covers the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.

# Developing Data Products 
This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics.
