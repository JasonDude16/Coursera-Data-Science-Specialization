# Human-Activity-Recognition-Project
This repository contains a folder called UCI HAR Dataset, a run_analysis.R script, a CodeBook.md file, and a Human-Activity-Recognition-Project.Rproj file (and of course this README.md file). 

The UCI HAR Dataset folder contains data and .txt files that provide detailed information about the data files. 

The run_analysis.R script imports, cleans, transforms, and summarizes the UCI HAR data.

The CodeBook.md file describes the UCI HAR data and variables. Much of the information in this file was copied directly from the .txt files that were included in the UCI HAR Dataset folder. Additionally, the .md file contains the entire run_analysis.R script, as well as a few sentences about what the code is doing. 

This repository is self-contained and can be replicated by:

1. Downloading / Cloning the repository
2. Opening the Human-Activity-Recognition-Project.Rproj file
3. Opening the run_analysis.R file and running the code
